# FallingBalls
The goal of this project is to make use of ray tracer created for VU graphics course and make short falling ball animation.

## Project Description
This project aims to create numbered batch images to mimic falling balls with different gravity parameters.
The collision system is not modeled in this project. To add collision system, integration of this and original project is needed, or a re-evaluation system for objects is needed(possibly by treating triangles and spheres seperately and setting up equations to find overlap portions, no overlap means no collision).
The "hard ground" for the stage is set to plane where y=0.
