# FallingBalls
The goal of this project is to make use of ray tracer created for VU graphics course to make short falling ball animation.

## Project Description
This project aims to create numbered batch images to mimic falling balls with gravity with parameters.  
The collision system is not modeled in this project. To add collision system, integration of this and original project is needed, or a re-evaluation system for objects is needed(which is a repeated process and inefficient).
